# 🔐 Security Checklist – Echo Identity System

This document outlines best practices and verification steps to ensure the `identity-backend` and related services are production-ready and secure.

---

## ✅ Identity Provider Security

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is strong and kept secret | Use `secrets.token_urlsafe(64)` and load from env |
| ✅ JWTs are short-lived | Typically 10–15 minutes |
| ✅ `verify()` endpoint enforces claims | Validates `exp`, `aud`, `iss` |
| ✅ Auth codes are single-use | Codes deleted after `/token` |
| ✅ Passwords are not logged or stored | Only in-memory for demo login |
| ✅ Rate limiting in place for `/login` and `/token` | Recommend Flask-Limiter or NGINX/Cloudflare rules |
| ✅ `DEV_MODE` is off in production | Hides test/debug routes |
| ✅ `/test-token` is removed in production | Avoids dev-only token issuance |
| ✅ HTTPS is enforced | Use TLS certs at the reverse proxy/load balancer |
| ✅ Only known `client_id` and `redirect_uri` allowed | Validated before login flow |
| ✅ Logging service JWT validation is strict | Ensures no spoofed logs are accepted |

## 🧾 Session and Cookie Security

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ Secure cookies | Flask should use `secure`, `httponly`, and `samesite` flags |
| ✅ Sessions cleared on logout | `session.clear()` invoked properly |
| ✅ No persistent session data in memory | Browser state only tied to short-lived JWTs |

---

## 🔒 Deployment and Secrets

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ All secrets loaded via `os.getenv()` | No hardcoded credentials |
| ✅ `.env` never used in production | Use cPanel or systemd for env injection |
| ✅ App fails to start if secret missing | `get_required_env()` enforces this |
| ✅ JWT issuer and audience checked explicitly | Prevents token reuse across systems |

---

## 🚧 Logging and Observability

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ No sensitive data in logs | Passwords, secrets, tokens are redacted |
| ✅ Logs go to a secure centralized service | `/log` uses JWT-protected endpoint |
| ✅ Token hash logged, not raw JWT | Use SHA256(token)[:12] for traceability |

---

## 🧼 Optional Improvements

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ⬜ Add `exp` check to auth code | Avoid reuse even if not exchanged |
| ⬜ Add CSRF protection on `/login` | Use Flask-WTF or referer validation |
| ⬜ Implement `x-request-id` headers | For tracing requests in logs |
| ⬜ Enforce IP whitelisting or device fingerprinting | Advanced session protection |
| ⬜ Add CAPTCHA on login | To deter brute force attacks |

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Run `jwt.io` to inspect token contents
- Try expired/modified tokens against `/verify`
- Simulate login with invalid client_id, redirect_uri
- Remove required env var and confirm app fails to boot
